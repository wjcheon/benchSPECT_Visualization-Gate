######
# The system acts as an interpretor between the GATE geometry and data outputs for reconstruction 
# in our case, the Interfile writer
# A system must know which components of the geometry are parts of the scanner, and what 
# their role are.
# For the moment, there is only a system SPECThead, which was built when the SPECThead volume
# was inserted. 
# The SPECThead system is made of three levels: base (for the head), crystal (for the crystal and crystal matrix) 
# and pixel (for individual crystals for pixellated gamma camera)
# For now, only the base of the system is attached to a volume: the volume SPECThead
# For the system to get information about your crystal, the level crystal must be attached to the volume 
# that has been defined for the scintillating crystal (crystal)

# GATE provides two sensitive detectors, which have two different functions
# Using them properly is very important for getting accurate results
##

# Crystal SD
#
# The crystal SD makes it possible to record hits in a sensitive volume (e.g.,. in a scintillation crystal)
# It must be attached to any volume for which hit-data must be obtained
# For recording hits in the NaI volume only, the name of which is crystal, this volume is attached 
# to the crystal SD
##

/gate/crystal/attachCrystalSD

# Phantom SD
#
# The phantom SD makes it possible to record Compton events in the volumes within the field of view
# This can provide information for result analysis to discriminate between 
# scattered and unscattered photons
# It must be attached to each and every volume for whom Compton interactions have to be recorded
